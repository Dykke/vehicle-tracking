POST /driver/password                 # Change password
GET  /driver/current-trip/<id>       # Get current trip info
```

### Admin (Admin Role Required)
```
GET  /admin/dashboard                # Admin dashboard view
GET  /admin/logs/actions            # Driver action logs
GET  /admin/trips                   # Trip data and summaries
GET  /admin/fleet/overview          # Fleet statistics
GET  /admin/drivers                 # All drivers list
GET  /admin/vehicles                # All vehicles list
POST /admin/driver/<id>/activate    # Activate driver
POST /admin/driver/<id>/deactivate  # Deactivate driver
```

## üéØ Key Features

**Overall MVP Completion: 100% of planned features**

## üîÆ Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Sprint)
1. Implement OTP for admin login
2. Add profile picture upload system
3. Enhance ETA with geocoding

### Short Term (2-3 Sprints)
1. Face verification system
2. Advanced analytics dashboard
3. Mobile app development

### Long Term (Future Releases)
1. Machine learning for ETA accuracy
2. Advanced reporting and analytics
3. Integration with external transport systems

## üêõ Known Issues

1. **ETA Calculation**: Currently uses default coordinates for destinations
2. **Profile Pictures**: Storage system not yet implemented
3. **Admin OTP**: Standard password authentication only
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Some UI elements need mobile refinement

## üìù Development Notes

- All new code follows existing project patterns
