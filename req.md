# Drive Monitoring System ‚Äî Feature Breakdown & Pricing Justification

### **Scope Assessment: 70-80% System Overhaul**

This is **NOT** a simple feature addition or minor update. This represents a **major system transformation** that touches nearly every aspect of your application. Here's why this work requires significant investment:

#### **üîÑ What Makes This Different from "Small Changes"**

| Small Changes (Free) | This Project (Paid) |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| CSS styling updates | Complete UI/UX overhaul |
| Adding simple forms | Advanced face verification system |
| Basic CRUD operations | Real-time GPS tracking & mapping |
| Text/content updates | OTP security implementation |
| Minor bug fixes | Complex role-based permissions |
| Database field additions | Real-time seat monitoring system |

#### **üöÄ Advanced Features Requiring Specialized Development**

1. **Face Verification System** - Requires integration with biometric APIs
2. **OTP Security** - SMS/email integration for admin accounts
3. **Live Seat Monitoring** - Real-time database updates and synchronization
4. **Proximity-based Boarding** - GPS accuracy within 20-40 meters
5. **ETA Calculations** - Advanced algorithms using speed and distance data

#### **‚è±Ô∏è Development Time & Complexity**

- **Previous Projects**: 6,000 PHP for ~60% system changes
- **This Project**: 70-80% system overhaul with advanced features
- **Testing Requirements**: Extensive testing for real-time features and security


-Changes Breakdown

1. Page URL and Login Flow
Change customer and admin page URLs so customers don‚Äôt need to log in first.

2. Full-featured Tracking Overhaul
Customers can view free slots in buses on a map.
Admin controls accounts; drivers log in with admin-provided accounts.
Admin (terminal) dashboard: See departed vehicles, vacant slots.
Driver: Can change password, update profile (with photo, license, etc.), adjust slot count (updates map).
User: Registration with selfie (face verification), full info, password show/hide, view vans, see available slots, ‚Äúsakay/in‚Äù within 20-40m, driver confirmation, ‚Äúbaba/out‚Äù (driver decrements slot).
OTP for admin.
ETA calculation (from pickup, based on speed).
Departure/arrival tracking.
Seat monitoring.
Location/time accuracy improvements.
Font style/size consistency.
Face verification for users.
Terms and policy update (user info visible on map).
Logging: Track who ‚Äúsakay/in‚Äù or ‚Äúbaba/out‚Äù per trip, with timestamp.
Paper (UI) alignment fixes.
Scope and Complexity Analysis
Major Modules/Features
Authentication Overhaul: Multi-role, OTP, face verification, registration changes.
Vehicle Tracking: Real-time map, slot management, ETA, seat monitoring.
Admin/Driver/User Dashboards: Role-based UI, profile management, logging.
UI/UX: Font consistency, alignment, password visibility, terms update.
Backend: Logging, accuracy improvements, new endpoints for all above.
Estimated System Impact
This is a major overhaul: new features, UI/UX changes, backend logic, and security.
Based on your previous pricing (6k PHP for 60% system change), this request is at least 70-80% of a full system rewrite, due to:
New modules (face verification, OTP, logging, ETA, map logic)
Major changes to registration, login, and dashboard flows
UI/UX and policy/legal updates

## **Suggested Investment: 7,000-8,000 PHP**

**Rationale:**
- 70-80% system overhaul (vs. 60% in previous projects)
- Advanced features requiring specialized development
- Real-time functionality requiring robust infrastructure
- Security implementations requiring careful development
- Professional-grade UI/UX overhaul
